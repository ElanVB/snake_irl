# snake_irl
Snake game distribution used to gather game data for IRL

---

### LIBRARIES USED:
virtualenv (helpful, but not necessary)  
numpy  
pygame  
pandas

### ABOUT:
This is the snake game with a fixed grid size of 8x8 and the aim of this exercise is to gather game data from at least 1000 different games. After the data has been gathered, Reinforcement Learning algorithms will be applied  with thet hope of the agent learning to play the game from you, the experts :)

### INSTALLATION:
*Note: This distribution requires Python 3.*
1. If you would like to use a vitual environment (which I highly recommend), and you don't have it installed, follow the instuctions in the text file labelled "Virtual_Environment.txt".
2. Clone or download the repo.
3. Run the following command:

   $ python setup.py install

4. If everything went well, you should have all the necessary libraries installed and you can now play the game using the following command:

   $ python play.py


### INSTRUCTIONS:
Run the game using the command above, and survive for as long as you possibly can while eating as much food as possible. Try to play at least 10 games, but obviously the more you can play, the better it is. So take a break from your research, relax and play a few games of snake

### CONTROLS:
The controls are the standard WASD for movement, however you can use the arrow keys if you wish.
When you die, you can simply press the SPACE bar to restart, or Q to quit.
